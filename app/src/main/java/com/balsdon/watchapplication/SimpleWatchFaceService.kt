 *
 * Important Note: Because watch face apps do not have a default Activity in
 * their project, you will need to set your Configurations to
 * "Do not launch Activity" for both the Wear and/or Application modules. If you
 * are unsure how to do this, please review the "Run Starter project" section
 * in the Google Watch Face Code Lab:
